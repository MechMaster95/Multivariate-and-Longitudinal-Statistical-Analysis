# Objectives

1. Let x=(5,1,3)T and y=(−1,3,1)T be two 3×1 column vectors.
Find the length of x and y (Do this by hand)
Find xTy (Do this by hand)
Are x and y orthogonal? Explain.
Repeat (a) and (b) using R. Provide code and output.


2. You are given a random vector X=[X1,X2,X3,X4]T with the mean vector μ=[4,3,2,1]T, and the variance-covariance
Find E(X) and E(AX).
Find cov(AX).


3. Consider the iris data available in R.
Construct side-by-side boxplots of the four quantitative variables (SL, SW, PL, PW) for each species. Do not forget to properly label the axes and give a proper title to the plots when needed. [Hint: your will have 3 plots, one for each species. Each plot will contain four boxplots. See the function boxplot() in R]

Construct a pairs-plot of the four variables for each of the three species.


4) Consider the skulls dataset in the HSAUR3 package in R. You will first need to install the package in R to access the dataset. Use ?skulls command to get more details on the data. A snapshot of the data is shown below.
library(HSAUR3)
