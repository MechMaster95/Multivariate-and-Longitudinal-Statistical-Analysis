# Topics in Multivariate and Longitudinal Statistics

This reposirtory discusses and implements the following concepts divided primarily into two parts

PART I: MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS
 
*  Principal component analysis
*  Factor analysis
*  Inference
*  Multivariate normal density. Likelihood function. Maximum likelihood estimation.
*  Inference about a single mean vector (Hotelingâ€™s T2, Likelihood ratio test, simultaneous confidence intervals)
*  Inference about two or more mean vectors (paired comparison, repeated measured design, MANOVA, profile analysis)
*  Inference beyond the mean vectors. Tests for the covariance matrix [covariance pattern/totally un-structured]. Tests for multivariate normality
* Classification
*  Clustering

PART II: LONGITUDINAL DATA ANALYSIS 
 
*  General Linear model
*  Parametric mean model: polynomial, spline, smooth functions where penalties are used to shrink the parameters]
*  Parametric models for covariance
*  Estimation and inference by maximum likelihood
*  Restricted maximum likelihood estimation
*  Linear mixed model (LMM)
*  Growth curves
*  Random coefficient model.
*  Estimation, inference, and prediction in linear mixed effects models
*  Generalized linear model (GLM)
*  Marginal models, generalized estimating equations (GEE): Estimation and inference of regression parameters
*  Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM): Estimation and inference
